      Responsibilities include:
      - Project : Chicken embryo model for retinal vein - like development
      - Utilized the Eyerobot platform to manually puncture veins and validated success through bubble formation
      - Automated the needle navigation and insertion with deep neural networks (ResNet and Yolov5) on micro 
      and B-mode images, respectively
      - Trained and refined the models using customized dataset collected from manual experiments. The model 
      achieved 86% of success rate and reduce the overall time by 21%

      Responsibilities include:
      -Project 1: C++ Software development for real-time motor control and communication
      - Implemented a two-way communication module for exchanging control commands between Jetson Nano 
      and middleware platform using UDP.
      - Designed and developed a shared memory mechanism to facilitate reliable inter-process access for the 
      control commands such that the motor can be controlled by commands directly acquired from the shared 
      memory. Additionally, this feature allows real-time monitoring and control across all hardware.
      - Implemented logging module between different components of the system.
      - Project 2: HeartLander
      - Recurrent whole pipeline

      Responsibilities include:
      - Project 1: Dual-robotic arm prostate ultrasound (US) tomography
      - Designed a calibration pipeline for the Abdominal Probe and TRUS Probe using Bxp and calculating 
      Transformation between Probe Bases using point cloud
      - Generated the probe trajectory in MATLAB using Inverse Kinematics and Virtual Fixture.
      - Result in an archived manuscript (tentatively).
      - Project 2: Motion tracking of moving phantom based on convolutional neural network
      - Defined the movement of the probe as in-plane motion and out-of-plane motion
      - Used K-Wave simulation to synthesize US images with specific speckle patterns for data augmentation
      - Automated the collection of the datasets and trained a CNN model to learn the Out-of-Plane motion from 
      speckle patterns in ultrasound images
